	  <p style="text-align:left"> Getting to know people is hard, but getting to know people online, is even harder. 

Human beings are not one-dimensional. We all sound, look, behave, and even smell differently, but these traits (some, thankfully) can't be experienced from behind a cold, digital screen.

No matter how advanced technology gets, there will always be a divide keeping us from truly knowing a person we've only spent time with online.

Unfortunately for marketers, the same difficulties could be said about brands. In fact, it's often harder to establish a personal connection with brands across the wide expanse of cyberspace.
